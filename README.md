# Experimenting with kr8s

I stumbled on the [kr8s project](https://github.com/kr8s-org/kr8s) recently and thought it might be a far easier way to integrate with Kubernetes than using the more traditional [Python Kubernetes Client](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python).

In this repository I host a simple Project to deploy as a Pod (or perhaps even several deployments of different pods) to take kr8s for a test drive.
